<h1>my views on Modern Physics</h1>

The site is primarily reflects a natural human property of curiosity about physical world, especially, our on edge knowledge of it, and a conception of truth in Mathematical and Physical Sciences. In other words, we are interested in current status and all aspects of Modern Physics Frontiers. The site is intended to give a room for an exchange of opinions of critically minded scientists free of mainstream dogmas and safe from mass media noise.
<br>

We witness a tremendous rapid development of new technologies of increasing precision of observations and measurements in micro, macro, and cosmic worlds. This happens, in our view, in contrast to a growing stagnation in Natural Sciences and Philosophy due to mainstream prevalence of dogmas and outdated concepts. A real threat to scientific progress in Physics comes from the fact that the main branches of Modern Physics have been developed with introduction of abstract mathematical structures having vague physical definitions. This means that the succession of Physical knowledge has been broken.
<br>

Some scientists would honestly argue that such a pessimistic picture is not correct, so a clash of argumentation must lead both sides “closer to truth”. However, one has to distinguish between conceptual criteria of truth in Physics of Nature and Mathematics of abstract world. Implementation of pure mathematical concepts without their explicit connections with the observable physical world is a risky way to mix up Scientific Physics with bad New Physics, or pseudo-Physics. A logic of such a situation is seen from a history of last century Physics.
<br>

The 20th Century revolution in Physics with an advent of Special Relativity theory has resulted in a radically new understanding of Classical Mechanics and Maxwellian electromagnetism. However, expansion of the theories to strong fields and fast motion required further development of SR Dynamics, which historically encountered methodological difficulties and fundamental problems, one of which, for example, is still unresolved problem of infinities. Controversies and paradoxes remain, often caused by a lack of opponents' understanding of the basic fact that SR Kinematics is SR Dynamics particular case of motion in space-time free of forces. Semi-Classically developed Quantum Mechanics still lacks a full implementation of the SR Dynamics Principles defined in the coordinate and momentum 4-spaces. Correspondingly, consistent electromagnetic field theories have not been developed.
<br>

Meanwhile, the transition from the world-view of Newtonian Gravitational Physics to Einstein's General Relativity world-view was proclaimed but, strangely, with the GR theory completely apart from Fundamental Classical and Modern Physics branches, including SR Kinematic and Dynamics. As a severe consequence, a development of relativistic quantum gravitational field in connections with Particle Physics became a long-standing, likely, unresolvable problem in principal. We consider the current Standard Particle Model a phenomenological (particle classification) model deprived of connections with Physical Foundations; it cannot be considered the theory.
<br>

Incompleteness and misconceptions of methodological implementations of Fundamental Physics Principles are the reality of Modern Physics crisis, without recognitions of which the genuine nature of ``gravity'', ``mass'', ``electricity'', ``charge'', ``spin'', ``physical vacuum'', ``quantum force carrier'' in their physical unity of quantum relativistic theories can never be unveiled.
<br>

Acceptance of incomplete or even false theories in Physics history is a normal and seemingly unavoidable occurrence, if temporarily. We state that the crisis has been historically growing over the time since Einstein's suggestion of GR gravitational theory and its application to Cosmology, when a replacement of fundamental physical concepts with abstract mathematical constructions was demonstrated and eventually retained in the current formulations of GR gravitational theory, also Standard Models of Cosmology and Particle Physics. The fact of internal contradictions of the theories (or the models) at the fundamental level and their conflicts with observations in many different ways is actually understood among Physical Community, but denied by “main stream” workers, or viewed as either controversies in interpretations or incompetence of opponents.
<br>

Now, we are talking about a crisis in Modern Physics, first of all, in interconnected theories of Gravitation and Cosmology. Further, you will see the results of our full analysis of both and a necessity of their replacement by alternatives, in agreement with numerous specific criticisms of other authors. This is the time to start distinguishing between a reality of Physical Nature and an absurdity of pure imagination, or Science and pseudo-Science.
<br>

The site is intended to organize an international group of researchers in Modern Physics, who understand the crisis, have a voice of disagreement, and their own arguments to share. We need a common reason and combined efforts to be heard to make a difference.
